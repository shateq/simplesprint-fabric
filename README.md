# Simple Sprint - Fabric
Basic (and open-source) toggle sprint for Minecraft! What it does, it's holding sprint key for you - when enabled.

## Usage
Select your keybind in Minecraft Controls Menu to use it ingame - after that you'll be notified.
Make your way to mod configuration using ModMenu's hooks, and change everything as you want :D

Modification is based off Orange Marshall's "[Simple Sprint](https://hypixel.net/threads/forge-1-8-9-simplesprint.677137/)" that was way too legacy to use with modern Fabric ecosystem so I refabricated that mod, adding some fancy gui and options.
