# Simple Sprint - Fabric
Basic (and open-source) toggle sprint for Minecraft! What it does, it's holding sprint key for you - when enabled.
Created, while thinking of multiplayer mode - it shouldn't be violent in my opinion.
Modification is based off Orange Marshall's "Simple Sprint" that was way too legacy to use with modern Fabric ecosystem so I refabricated that mod, adding some fancy gui and options.
